                              YSI - Master Include
                             ======================
Description:
	Handles distribution of control of code segments across all running scripts
	with YSI to avoid conflicts of checkpoint streamers etc and allow features
	like "/commands" displaying all commands on the server.
	
	Now fully autonomous - to use the master system simply define which one you
	want and include the script:
	
	  #define MASTER 14
	  #include "Master"
	
	That will make the current script attempt to make itself the main master -
	you don't need ANY other code for initialisation anywhere (which took a
	while to figure out)...
	
	This is now over 2000 lines of repetitive and complex macros!

Version:
	0.2
Changelog:
	06/08/10:
		Managed the ultimate - got completely transparent inclusion!
	05/08/10:
		Completed new master system, now does all syncing and clients.
	06/10/09:
		Rewrote using states.
		Added remote function macros.
		Reduced the number of masters to a single one.  It must have them all.
		Vastly simplified the master model - ending the master ends everything.
	06/01/08:
		Added code to not pass data if no other script exists.
	17/11/07:
		Added code for a script to remove itself from the global list.
	11/10/07:
		Not first version but added documentation months late.
