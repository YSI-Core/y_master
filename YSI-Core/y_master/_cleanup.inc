				              YSI - Master Include
				             ======================
Description:
	Handles distribution of control of code segments across all running scripts
	with YSI to avoid conflicts of checkpoint streamers etc and allow features
	like "/commands" displaying all commands on the server.
	
	Now fully autonomous - to use the master system simply define which one you
	want and include the script:
	
	  #define MASTER 14
	  #include "Master"
	
	That will make the current script attempt to make itself the main master -
	you don't need ANY other code for initialisation anywhere (which took a
	while to figure out)...
	
	This is now over 2000 lines of repetitive and complex macros!
